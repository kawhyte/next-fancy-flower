            For as long as I remember, I always enjoyed cooking and baking but decorating cakes was something else. I remember the first time I observed my cousin’s wife making a wedding cake. I was fascinated and said to myself “I would love to do this one day.” I was just a teenager. She taught me to make basic roses for a cake she was doing and I was hooked. I continued baking basic recipes over the years just for family and friends who encouraged me to take this further. I decided to take their advice and completed cake decorating courses and before you know it, ‘fancyflowercakes’ was born.
